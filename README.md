The default Java play application generated by running the "play new" command contains a number of
stylistic problems, including:

  * Wildcard imports.
  * Superfluous imports (referencing code not used in class).
  * No package-level documentation (i.e. no package-info.java files).
  * No class or method level JavaDocs.
  * Inconsistent indentation.
  
When such an application is processed using Checkstyle with a reasonable ruleset, 
approximately 50 warnings are generated.

This application provides a corrected version of the default Java Play application, with all of
those warnings removed.
