{"name":"Play-new-passcheckstyle","tagline":"A default play project that passes checkstyle.","body":"The default Java Play application generated by running the \"play new\" command contains a number of\r\nstylistic problems, including:\r\n\r\n  * Wildcard imports.\r\n  * Superfluous imports (referencing code not used in class).\r\n  * No package-level documentation (i.e. no package-info.java files).\r\n  * No class or method level JavaDocs.\r\n  * Inconsistent indentation.\r\n  * Test code is located in the default package.\r\n  * View template names (*.scala.html) should follow Java class naming conventions since they compile into \r\n    Java classes. Thus, index.scala.html is renamed to Index.scala.html, and main.scala.html is renamed to\r\n    Main.scala.html.\r\n  \r\nWhen such an application is processed using Checkstyle with a reasonable ruleset, \r\napproximately 50 warnings are generated.\r\n\r\nPlay-new-passcheckstyle implements a revised version of the default Java Play application, with all of\r\nthose warnings removed.  \r\n\r\nYou can use the \"diff\" feature of GitHub to figure out exactly what changes were made.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be awesome if the Play developers fixed the \"new\" command in some\r\nfuture release to generate a default application using [best practices for Java coding style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Java_Style).\r\n   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
